# **Welcome to the Danish Reproducibility Network!**

The Danish Reproducibility Network (DKRN) is a peer-led consortium located in Denmark. It follows an organisational format adopted internationally as nationwide [“Reproducibility Networks”](https://www.ukrn.org/international-networks/). The DKRN collaborates with the other Reproducibility Networks whilst remaining a unique and independent community.

## **Our mission**

DKRN is a platform that connects Denmark-based researchers aiming to promote, facilitate and educate about open, reproducible and robust research. We aim to achieve this through fostering collaborations on projects and through the organisation of events. Our work will ensure that Denmark remains an integral part of world-leading efforts contributing to the dissemination of best research practices and positive culture change in academia.

### **Contributors needed:**  
  
We are currently looking for representatives of academic and research institutions across Denmark to join the DKRN and contribute to projects on local and national scale. Our consortium welcomes contributions from researchers at all academic levels from all research disciplines, librarians, lab and research managers, research and academic educators as well as representatives of societies, associations and grant funding organisations. Get in touch with us directly at danish.repro@gmail.com   
  
**A special call for PhD students to help with a journal club**  
We are looking for enthusiastic PhD students to contribute to a Denmark-based [ReproducibiliTea Journal Club](https://reproducibilitea.org/). The journal meetings will be held remotely and we will discuss interdiciplinary papers on matters relating to open, reproducible and transparent research.
