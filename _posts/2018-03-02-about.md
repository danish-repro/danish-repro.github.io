# **Welcome to the Danish Reproducibility Network!**

The Danish Reproducibility Network (DKRN) is a peer-led consortium located in Denmark. It follows an organisational format adopted internationally as nationwide [“Reproducibility Networks”](https://www.ukrn.org/international-networks/). The DKRN collaborates with the other Reproducibility Networks whilst remaining a unique and independent community.

## **Our mission**

DKRN is a platform that connects Denmark-based researchers aiming to promote, facilitate and educate about open, reproducible and robust research. We aim to achieve this through fostering collaborations on projects and through the organisation of events. Our work will ensure that Denmark remains an integral part of world-leading efforts contributing to the dissemination of best research practices and positive culture change in academia.  
  
**More information**  

We recently published a paper about the conceptualization, organizational structure and purpose of the network in BMC Research Notes: [A grassroots approach to peer support by the Danish Reproducibility Network](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-024-06912-7)   

This infographic gives an overview of the structure we envision:

**A special call for PhD students to help with a journal club**  
We are looking for enthusiastic PhD students to contribute to a Denmark-based [ReproducibiliTea Journal Club](https://reproducibilitea.org/). The journal meetings will be held remotely and we will discuss interdisciplinary papers on matters relating to open, reproducible and transparent research.
