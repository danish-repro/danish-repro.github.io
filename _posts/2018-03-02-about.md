# Welcome to the Open Science Community Eindhoven!



We are a growing group of **researchers, engineers, scientists and university faculty** who care about **transparency and quality in science**. Our goal is to form an **inclusive community** of people working on improving the way we conduct open science at the Eindhoven University of Technology, and to help others do the same. 

Interested in joining the OSC/e? No problem! You can join the discussion on our **[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openscienceeindhoven)** or send a mail to **[osceindhoven@gmail.com](mailto: osceindhoven@gmail.com)** if you have questions. 

We also have regular meetups and **<a href="#events">campus-wide events</a>** that you are welcome and encouraged to join.
