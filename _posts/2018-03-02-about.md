# **Welcome to the Danish Reproducibility Network!**

The Danish Reproducibility Network (DKRN) is a peer-led consortium located in Denmark. It follows an organisational format adopted internationally as nationwide [“Reproducibility Networks”](https://www.ukrn.org/international-networks/). The DKRN collaborates with the other Reproducibility Networks whilst remaining a unique and independent community.

## **Our mission**

DKRN is a platform that connects Denmark-based researchers aiming to promote, facilitate and educate about open, reproducible and robust research. We aim to achieve this through fostering collaborations on projects and through the organisation of events. Our work will ensure that Denmark remains an integral part of world-leading efforts contributing to the dissemination of best research practices and positive culture change in academia.  
  
**More information**  

We recently published a paper about the conceptualization, organizational structure and purpose of the network in BMC Research Notes: [A grassroots approach to peer support by the Danish Reproducibility Network](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-024-06912-7)   

This infographic gives an overview of the structure we envision:

#### **Join discussions at our Copenhagen-based ReproducibiliTea Journal Club meetings**  
You can join informal discussion sessions focusing on open and reproducible science. This is open to all ECRs (PhD students and postdocs) as well as senior academics and anyone interested in research.   
Follow the journal club's [LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/reproducibilitea-copenhagen/posts/?feedView=all) to see advertisements of all upcoming sessions.  
We are meeting every two months, on the last Friday of the month.  
If you have questions, email Stefana at stefana.aicoboaie.01@regionh.dk or at jcreproducibilitea@gmail.com.  
**Or if you are based outside of Copenhagen, perhaps you want to start your own journal club?**   

[ReproducibiliTea Journal Club](https://reproducibilitea.org/) is a global ECR initiative. You can get involved in the organisation of the journal club and meet other ECRs in other institutions and countries who do similar activities.
