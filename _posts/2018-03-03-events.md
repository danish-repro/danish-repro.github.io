# Upcoming Events

## In-person workshop 10 April 2025 at 13:00 - Promoting Robust Research Culture**

Join us on **Thursday 10 April 2025** for an in-person workshop on promoting robust research culture!
Location: Pioneer Centre for AI, Copenhagen

**Registration**: Free but spaces are limited [-> SIGN UP HERE <-](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/workshop-promoting-robust-research-culture-tickets-1226565383079?aff=oddtdtcreator) 

**Description**: In this first of our in-person workshop series (three total), we will hear short presentations about the speakers' experiences with leading research projects and teams. Specific focus will be placed on cultivating a positive, robust and transparent research culture promoting the implementation of open and reproducible research practices.

**Programme:**
* 13:15 - Welcome and information about the DKRN
  
* 13:20 - **Dr. Cyril Pernet**, *Senior Research Software Developer at Neurobiology Research Unit, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet*

**My journey into datasharing** - Dr. Pernet will talk about his work on standardising datasharing in the field of neuroimaging and in particular his journey working on the OpenfMRI project, later OpenNeuro, which ultimately led to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) community.

* 13:50 - **Anne Thorst Melbye**, *Head of Research Documentation at the University of Southern Denmark*

**As ambitious as possible – as closed as necessary** - Ms. Melby will give a talk about her work revising and implementing an Open Science policy at University of Southern Denmark including the ups and down and how to come around some of the challenges.

* 14:20 - Tour of the telescope
  
* 14:40 - **Dr. Luke W. Johnston**, *Team Leader at the Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University and Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus*
  
**Integrating open and reproducible practices within a research organization** - Dr. Johnston’s talk will focus on how advocating for and implementing open and reproducible practices within a research organization can be extremely challenging. During this talk, Dr. Johnston will share his experiences on and struggles with advocating for more openness and reproducibility within research environments and how this led to multiple organization-wide changes at the Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus. He will go over some practical examples of what practices are now being integrated within Steno Aarhus, with a focus on three main areas of work: using the UK Biobank, DP-Next project, and general GitHub use.
  
* 15:10 - Discussion with invited speakers
  
* 16:00 - Social gathering and networking
