### D3A Conference 2024  
We are going to present a workshop titled:  
**Level up your data & life science lab's reproducibility!** 
  
We collected short videos from researchers in different disciplines at various institutions. They talk about the open and reproducible research practices applied in their work.  
You can see them all on our [YouTube Channel!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_1e-w-2s_U&list=PLJPfqQPI6i_AfAP4U6zMOSuM9X2GlsHyC&pp=iAQB)
